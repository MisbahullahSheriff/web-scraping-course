- **What is Web Scraping?**
  - Definition and importance of web scraping.
  - Difference between scraping and web crawling.
  
- **Ethical Considerations**

- **Data on the Web**

- **Tools for Web Scraping**
  - Overview of tools like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Selenium`.

## 2. Setting up Python Environment

Before starting with web scraping, setting up your environment is crucial for success. In this section, we cover how to prepare your Python environment for web scraping.

- **Anaconda**
  - Installation and setup of Anaconda for Python development.
  
- **Installing Necessary Libraries**
  - How to install libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, and others using `pip` or `conda`.

## 3. Primer on Web

Understanding how the web works is essential for effective scraping. This section provides a primer on how websites interact and the key components you need to know to scrape efficiently.

- **How Websites Interact**
  - Explanation of client-server interaction.
  - Basic architecture of the web and HTTP requests.
  
- **HTTP Methods**
  - Overview of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and how they are used in scraping.
  
- **Status Codes**
  - Understanding HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.) and how to handle them in your scraper.

## 4. Interacting with the Web using Requests

The `requests` library is one of the most fundamental tools for interacting with the web. This section covers the basics of how to send HTTP requests and handle responses.

- **Sending GET Requests**
  - How to send GET requests to fetch HTML content from web pages.
